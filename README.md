# Tech 201 Functions

Functions in Python are a great way for us to write and execute more complex code easier.

### Creating a Function
```Python
def print_something():    # Creates our function
    print("Something has been printed")    # what we want our function to do
```
We create our functions via the keyword `def` which means to define a function, following which we write our function name with a pair of parentheses at the end and a colon.
Similarly to for loops and if statements etc. functions require indentation, in which we write what we want our function to do.
